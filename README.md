# Interactive-Hierarchical-Modeling---OpenGL-Puppet
This project involves creating a 3D animated puppet using OpenGL and C++. The puppet is constructed in a hierarchical manner using basic primitives like cubes, spheres, and cones. It includes interactive elements such as keyboard controls for manipulating the puppet's parts and animations simulating walking movements.
